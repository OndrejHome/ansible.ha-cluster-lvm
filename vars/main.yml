# Detect if the root file system is on LVM and if so detect which VG it uses
# LOGIC:
# for mount in ansible_mounts - iterate through all mountpoints
#   if mount['mount'] == '/' - once the root filesystem mountpoint is found
#     for i in ansible_lvm['lvs'] - iterate through all LVs in 'lvs'
#       set a = ansible_lvm['lvs'][i]['vg']|replace('-','--')
#       set b = i|replace('-','--')
#       set c = [ '/dev/mapper/', a, '-', b ]|join
#       if mount['device'] == c - if the output from 'lvs' constructed int path for /dev/mapper matches the root filesystem
#         ansible_lvm['lvs'][i]['vg'] - print out the VG name of root file system
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUTS:
#  - <empty> - on systems without LVM or with LVM that is not used for root file system
#  - VG_name - on systems where root file system is on LV from VG_name
